I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia, advised by Professor [Jundong Li](https://jundongli.github.io/). I received my B.E. in Computer Science from University of Science and Technology of China in 2022.

My research interests lie in the multi-modality application of Large Language Models.
